I welcome any contribution!

### How to contribute (will add a proper and more detailed guide later)

#### Project setup

- Have node installed, preferably node v14.17.6 (that's the version I'm using)
- Have yarn installed
- Clone this repo
- cd into the root folder of the repo: `cd syncbase/`
- and then simply run `yarn`

#### Contribution flow

- Fork this repo and submit a pull request to the main branch of the original repo

### TODO

- Actually develop the project
  - Read up on mikro-orm docs
  - DB Migrations
- Deploy web on vercel and server and it's services on DO droplet and maybe some automatic deployment with gh actions
- Add docker & docker-compose for development maybe
- Maybe add standard-version/semantic-release
- Add tests e.g. jest for unit and integration tests and crypress for E2E tests
