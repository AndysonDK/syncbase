# Server

We're running jest with the `--no-cache` option in CI because jest will stop working after 7 days of no
CI runs because GitHub will [delete](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows) all caching by then.

Will add more helpful documentation for contributors related to the server here later!
