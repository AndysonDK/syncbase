    // We are using the retired graphql playground to test our graphql endpoint for now.
    // The reason is that apollo studio 3 (default tool) requires cookies to
    // have the following settings: secure: true & sameSite: "none".
    // But express-session currently doesn't allow setting secure cookies from a http site
    // To fix this issue we could do what is stated here:
    // https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/5775
    // and there are probably also some other workarounds (reverse proxy using https etc.)
    // but we don't like nasty workarounds here!
    // I think the best solution is probably to wait for the following issue to be solved:
