Will add more helpful documentation for contributors related to the frontend here later!

### Notes

- Soon chromatic will be able to run [accessibility tests](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/test-runner#whats-the-difference-between-chromatic-and-test-runner) automatically with test runner, we'll wait for that update to arrive
