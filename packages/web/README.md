# Web

Will add more helpful documentation for contributors related to the frontend here later!

### Data Fetching

All authenticated content should be fetched client side since this won't be indexed by SEO. Everything else should be fetched server side for better SEO performance. We will be using next-urql for this.

Will will also be using next-i18next for internationalization server side including next.js builtin internationalization routing feature!

### Notes

- Soon chromatic will be able to run [accessibility tests](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/test-runner#whats-the-difference-between-chromatic-and-test-runner) automatically without us having to use the test runner explicitly, we'll wait for the update to arrive
